## Modding Behind The Scenes <author>stringweasel</author>

It's [worth repeating](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-21/) that Factorio has an absolutely amazing modding community. That said, you might not realize just how much effort some modders need to go through to create their masterpieces. Especially when they start running into engine limitations. The Factorio developers do [try and expand](https://forums.factorio.com/viewforum.php?f=28) the engine to give modders more flexibility, but it's impractical to allow modders to do _everything_ they want. So, when modders reach a limit of what Factorio allows them to do, they need to get creative to achieve their vision. What they come up with are usually interesting and crazy ~~hacks~~ workarounds which the player often doesn't even notice. I always find these workarounds fascinating, so I reached out to a few modders and asked them about their favourite stories of how they bent Factorio to their will.

### Share your story!

What you read above is only a handful of the stories I heard, and we will release another article with even more scary modding stories from other modders in the future. If you're a modder with an interesting ~~hacking~~ workaround story, or anything to do with Factorio, then let us know! We would love to tell the world about it. And it's important to talk about such traumatic events, because keeping it all inside is never good. It might slow down the growth of your factory, after all. Wouldn't want that.
