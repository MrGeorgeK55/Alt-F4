# r/place: A Monetary Lapse of Time

Over the past weekend most avid redditors had a momentary lapse of time as the world was caught up in r/place. Hundreds of thousands of people were avidly sitting behind their screen. Masses and masses were excitely waiting for their 5 minute timer to run out so that they could place their next little pixel. They weren't neccesarily excited about the pixel itself though. No, it was about being part of the bigger image. Contributing to the common goal of your community. It was about together achieving something great, and leaving something beautiful behind on the r/place canvas.

## What is r/place?

The annoucement was at ??.  Here is a [nice visualization](https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/) about all the different artworks placed in the first event.

And here is what we created now!

## The Journey

It started with a [thread](https://discord.com/channels/139677590393716737/959132842787487814) in the Factorio Discord on 31 March in preperation for r/place to start. However, nothing happened initially, except showing what Factorio did at the previous event. It was only after a brief discussion in our own Alt-F4 Discord server that the first pixel was placed at `{271,555}` by *stringweasel*. This was then forwarded to the main Discord, and it all started! The reference image was simply the picture of what was used in 2017, but soon *ivanjermakov* stepped up became our dedicated blueprint designer by creating the first blueprint seen below:

The canvas was still empty when the initial spot was chosen, but of course, there were always threats for a community to draw over us. The first such threat was the only real other art in the vicinity, the Belgium flag coming up from the South. So peace treaties were sent by (??). It was in this time that the next blueprints were being created to include belts. However, there was a problem with getting the last `O` in Factorio to be a _gear_, because misguided troops were trying to create a normal `O`. This led to some very [strange looking](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/959132842787487814/959481710414815232/unknown.png) hoops. It was only after some time that the gear was redesigned and successfully drawn. As soon as the basic idea for the gear was visible (and many DMs sent) the troops finished and defended the gear. Work began on the Northen belt. It started fairly sparked controversy: should the belt have alternating grey-black pixels (similar to 2017) at the bottom or a solid grey line? However, the bigger issue was again that misguided Factorians removed any attempt to bring in the line below the arrows. It was only much later that the belt finally became vertically symmetrical - well after the decision to do a solid-grey line because it's easier.

Juxtapose: The first official blueprint (left) used on the r/place in 2022, as made by *ivanjermakov*. On the right is one of the last iterations of this blueprint. At the end it had some [underneathies](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-9/#underneathies) and another blue circuit.
![](media/first-blueprint.png)
![](media/final-ish-benchy-blueprint.png)

The time of the great belt-controversy was luckily also the time of new friends. Our Northern belt was on it's way to cover the merry green little boat named Benchy - [r/3Dprinting/](r/3Dprinting/)'s infamous mascot. A user named SevenAndAHalf came to ask for peace, because they had to move their beloved Benchy once already. It was excitely decided that we will become friends with them, and have Benchy riding on our belt! However, again, it took some time to convince the isolated troops that the belt should go _behind_ the green boat. Regardless, good relations were established with r/3Dprinting, and many r/Factorio pixels were placed in aid of Chile destroying Benchy's roof. Benchy's bottom even became part of our official blueprint, and SevenAndAHalf became a honourable ally!

Soon Benchy was on the belt, and our belt was making it's way around the bottom of our logo. By this time there was three gears ("Factoriooo"?) and it was decided that two of these gears should be replaced by circuit. Yet again, the unamed reddit troops were veciously defendending the gears, making it impossible to draw *ivanjermakov*'s beautiful circuits over it. Here is were our own *Nano* stepped in and created a Google Sheet, where everybody chose a pixel (or few) they could place at the signal. As one voice he and SpeckledFleebeedoo screamed charge, and we all placed our loaded pixels simultaniously. And suddenly a fresh green circuit materialized. Success! This method was used quite often from that point forward, for inserters, science packs, even nukes.

TODO had to replace two gears with circuits where *Nano* really helped! This method was used a lot...

![There was even a moment when some streamer decided to an unsolicited attack which almost hit us (Image captured by aptly named *mxdanger*)](media/xqc-threat.png) 

What happened then with xQc?

Soon we made more allys with the people around us... I would like to name them. Do we know who were their reps?

## Double or Nothing

At ?? hours the canvas size unexpectedly doubled, the number of colours doubled, and so did the tension. Many communities scrambling for space while trying to determine what to draw after the initial inrush of trolls. Even in our community tensions were high because there were suddenly many excited voices with design ideas and attack plans. After some floudering we ended up securing `{1600,550}`, because as *Stuckey* suggested, this would allow the possibility of connecting an underground belt to our previous location which is at the same y-level! Thus, a plan was put kicked into action. We will secure the area with belts initially, as laid out by *pg*'s blueprints, while we wait for *ivanjermakov* pixelated intepretation of the Factorio gear.

 Our plan https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/959485980761534545/959912297202057268/unknown.png
Starting area

As you might know, the area was secured successfully. Allies were made, battles were faught, and pixels were lost, as told later. However, first doubling of the size wasn't the last of the tricks up Reddit's sleeve. No, after ?? hours the canvas doubled in size yet again! And there was so much open space, which for a long time was wild with flags and amongus. Luckily, this move was anticipated by the Factorio community, and we had a plan! The [talented](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bumble-bots) Discord moderator, *Maxreader*, pre-emptively drew up plans for a locomotive and wagons. Aliances were was also made with other communities, who would "ride" on our wagons, and help us defend the train. (Who's idea? Mr_George). Even though were quicker in our movements this time around in choosing and securing location around `{500, 1200}` (again recommended by *Stuckey*), but so were other communities. Were quickly ran out of room and were tucked in tightly - next to quite salacious neighbour - with only room for one wagon occupied by our friends from Mindustry.

We built a locomotive, and it was beautiful! ,,,, Later the Aztec Sun Stone on the Mexican flag began to grow, and there was no way to stop it. It vert

*/
in the begining of the first Canvas expansion we decided we needed something to represent us, we decided to build the Gear.
at first we only had the idea but really we didnt have a design, we tried to convert the logo to the colors given by reddit, the problem, Too complex and too many colors to be able to build something, so in the time some users were modifing the logo design, our army had to secure the area and what is the best to told others than is factorio planning on that area? **BELTS**, we started building belts all arround this wasnt easy because the void were on the middle of the design. we did our best to secure the area.

by the time the area was mostly secure, the user apatton designed a much simpler image of the gear of our logo, easy to build and built only using 5 colors.
the plan was ready, our plan was sent to the alliances. They Really liked our design so they started to build with us, then the void started attacking us. were on the middle of the gear costruction when the void attacked, destroying partially the area of #100devs, we had inflitrated users on the void Discord server so we knew their plans. Pikmin, Danidev, #100Devs even Norway aliance helped us to Fight the void. after some time the plans of the void changed they were facing north to continue their attack, our space was safe once again. it took us a long time to be able to build the gear but we did it, our gear was completed.
after our gear was completed, we make some redesigns to te belts arround us and some minor improvments.
Then Romania contacted us by their  ambassador Ironic_Onion, their proposal was to let us expand our belts only if we matched their colors with their flag, this was the beginning with the aliance with them. after we build the expansion on the belts an enemy approached. ***ECUADOR!***
Ecuador was a big country with almost 18.6 Million people, the problem they werent online. at first we tried to stop their attacks defending danidev. but the problem with Ecuador is than many of their people werent on Discord or Reddit to be able to comunicate with them r/Ecuador blocked all posts about r/place so was too dificult to comunicate with them.
the user Mr_George take this duty on their hands, what he find out was Ecuatorian people Had **6 Different Discords servers** nobody was really listening and their efforts to organize was null, something has to be done. The negotiations with Ecuador were too difficult to establish, all the discords were aggreing on the peace and allye with us, but most part was the hivemind.
Many hours later, Ecuador started attacking again, this time more powerfull taking down danidev and then taking some space in our belts and they dont stoped there. The negotiations where again too difficult to stablish, The factorio ambassador was jumping from each discord servers where ecuatoria¿ns has benn making their plans to stop them, we also had a HalfCog-HalfHeart with ecuator flag to show our allaiance but, once again, the hivemind were too powerfull. even we tried to offer a peace but non of this worked. 
we let ecuator to have their letters, to focus on polishing our design. in this time we did figuratvelly conected The first logo on the left side!.
then, a sudden attack came from *Romania?* Yes, they werent backstabing us, their plan was to build a monument called Infinity column, wich the hivemind took it to seriusly, at this time Mr.George contacted Romania to tell about the attack, thankfully all their members understand and started to help against the hivemind. we even had a emergency plan in case romania werent unable to stop the attack. Romania was able to stop the atack and we rebuilt our belts.
by this time we had all under control, were defending eventually while ecuador was sleeping, and thinking about the final designs adjustig the belts when **BOOM** the canvas was doubled in size again.
we faster started to build our plan previously discussed. by now im only telling the Battle of the Nut, so the details of the Factorio Train Project are just after this section.
 Oh boy, with most of the people trying to build the new project who are going to defend?!, well we did our best, while everyone was trying to claim new space the same as us lees people was defending our Gear. so we got distracted, then Ecuador Attacked Again. This time an spanic streamer cordinated the attack to The pikmin below us, our ally. all the people was fighting at the same time to defend, claim a new area and defend our allies, unfotunely while were busy building the train, after this we belived were safe, but the human trash called xQc had the intention of creating a new void, this one was soo close to destroy us, passing literraly a few pixels at our right but destroying #100devs and Nep Nep art in the process. they were able to rebuild everithing with our help, then a few hours later Ecuador Attacked again, this time expanding thowards the gear and cutting in half our bottom Belts. 
were unable to stop their attacks and claimed another area of our gear, our people were pissed off, at this point our alliance was forgoten, and before we had the time to attack, something happend, an Polish streamer started Invading the Romanian Flag where also an Romanian Streamer were fighting, on this atttack we lost the belts over Romania, why is important this? not because we are forgeting our alliance with Romania but because all the ecuatorians saw an oportunity to attack Polish flag,
at this time were a few hours to the end of r/place, this fight with streamers ended up in the attack of our gear, we quickly contacted many Alliances to help us to **HOLD THE NUT** and also all the atention ended up with the destruction of Ecuador completly form r/place but in the sad way, it also destroyed our gear, we fight the best we could
with sadnes in our hearts we contempled the destruction of our most preciated Symbol, the hopes where lost as were minutes away form the ending of r/place
though, we at least hold our main base, and the most part of the train.

Now, youre wondering, why is called The battle of the **Nut** if our design was a **Gear**?!
Well https://www.reddit.com/r/ecuador/comments/tw2iam/conquistemos_esa_parte_de_ah%C3%AD_hagan_una_nueva/
those people form ecuador tried to conquer another zone an because of our "alliance" (Almost inexistent) they were refering to us as the Nut


//i dont know where i can put this
i want to do a small pause here, as a fellow reddit moderator called AgentEightysix wrote "I'm gonna be a dad soon, my little girl is gonna be named Violet, so I wanted to add a violet next to the Factorio build somewhere" all the community was moved by this, so we worked hard to build a flower right next to our gear.
we defend it with everything we had... 

## The Factorio Train Project

The begining of this idea was to build a locomotive somewere at the time of the seccond and final expansion of the canvas. Again Mr_George Suggested that to be able to build and mantain such a big proyect we are going to need help, help from who? you wondering, the best aproach was to share wagons of the train with other comunities, the catch, they must help us to build our locomotive.
This is the **Factorio Train Project** were multiple communities were contacted to build our locomotive and in exchange they will get an empty wagon to customize.
the communities contacted were Mindustry, Unturned, Sea of thieves, Germany, Risk of rain, india and Furry_irl.
we planned to have a long train but we quickly got surrounded by big comunities that didnt got convinced by the idea. such as India, Halo, Sea of thieves and Germany.
with such small area to build were only be able to build one wagon, the **Mindustry** Alliance!, they started with us to build the locomotive, and their wagon. but a new problem apeared, The community of Risk of Rain were building their logo just in the half of ours, we have to quickly contact them to negotiate their design in exchange of a custom wagon, the deal was done. they moved their design a few pixels below.
in the time of the train construction, we realized we hadd less space than we expected, so in order to build more Wagons, we contacted the portal comunity to help us to build a portal leading to another zone, unfortunely the portal comunnity were building 3 big projects so they were unable to help us. then the Furry_irl, Unturned and risk of rain comunities gave up on the project so we only keep the Mindustry wagon.
The train was done, the only thing we needed to do is defend. this is the area were attacked us most of the time, at first was the Yellow Void, attacking everything in their way, partially destroying our train and Mindustry wagon, we fight aganist this void and we defennded succesfully. the second attack came from an streamer called xQc (A human Trash) decided to invade a big area just bellow our train, were too close to being destroyed and we got lucky than didnt attack us. this attack killed Risk of rain design, a few hours later by the cordination of another streamer this time mexican, they expanded their flag building over the half of our locomotive. many people of mexico tryied to stop the streamer but it was to late, our train got chopped. 


## The r/Place Ending

What a Weird and sad moment when we realize that this was the end, everything was ever built form every community, every pixel of any color, placed by a person or a bot, everthing we fight to hold from the past 3 and a half days it, we all slowly watched everythig turning white. what a poetic way to end with everything, Reddit changed the pallete of colors reducing all the options to only white.

as another member said:
The whole internet came together for this one big war. every single corner of the internet.
the entire spectrum, from republicans to democrats, vegans to barbecuers, bronies to weebs, gamers to athletes, metalheads to country folks, formula 1 racers to r/FUCKCARS, against xQc, some streamers, and hundreds of thousands of 9 year olds.
with moderators, strategies, backstabbing, allies, territory, expansions, treaties, robots, constitutions, spies, among us, giant dicks, sabotages, raids, porn, voids, and pure destruction.
all in 4 days. all completely improvised.
this is absolutely fucking brilliant. I'm pumped for the inevitable 10 hour documentary coming out of this, detailing every war, ally, and conflict like this is a fucking anime. It sure felt like one. This gave me more adrenaline than Rust, Ark, or Minecraft ever did.

Here we are,
The finale of the internet.
We have successfully defended our territories until the very end.
After 100+ raids, we restored everything.
All of our enemies surrendered.

R/place ended.

We won.
The whole point of the white void, is that it's not about the final image, it's about the journey.
Countless wars, allies, friends, territories.
Now we're cleaning our mess up.
White is the color of peace.
We are returning back to the way it once was, united, and peaceful, across the entire canvas. We're all equal now, as we were before.
This isn't the good or bad ending, this is the true ending.
This is the most cinematic, best ending for r/place that even I couldn't think of. This shit feels like the ending of portal 2.
All of us united, as complete strangers, now best friends, all over a stupid fucking pixel war.

Thanks to Everyone Involved on this adventure and Historic event of the internet

## The Finality of the Anti-Void

In the last moments came the Anti-Void. Nobody expected it.....

The Factorio community performed valiantly during the r/place insident. There were many foes around that threatened our well-established area. Trolls, rainbows, hordes of amungus, and even a deady void. But the community stood strong, and importantly built strong alliances with our neighbours by incorporating them into our master blueprint. This allowed us to withstand the test of time, and thus have our monument carved into the halls of time, never to be forgotten. Or at least, until the next r/place or amungos inevitably take over.
